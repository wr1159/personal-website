## About

This is my personal website made with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Shadcn UI](ui.shadcn.com).

This is my first time using Astro and I have always wanted to try using it since I have heard great things about it. I chose to use Astro for my personal website due to its speed and compatibility with many frontend frameworks I am familiar with.
